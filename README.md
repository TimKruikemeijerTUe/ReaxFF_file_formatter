# ReaxFF_file_formatter
ReaxFF files are often provided as PDFs in papers. This script converts that to the standard format. It is based on [EZFF](https://github.com/arvk/EZFF), though simplified and updated. This script will likely not (often) be updated and is therefore not provided as packages but only as is.
